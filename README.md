So there is a couple of different things im struggling with.

1/ The 'slider' container has an absolute position so that it remains behind the landing pages 'slide up' and 'slide down' container so when animated they appear from behind. However with this new position the 'project' section of the 'slider' (which has overflow set) wont scroll, the bar is greyed out. If i remove the absolute position it fixes this issue but the 'slider' is now under the two slides instead of behind. How could I correct this and have it working how i want?

2/ I have a 'magic-line' in the nav to correspond which section is selected. Its starting position is set to its selected li element. However now i have added some java script to hide the magic line on opening, when it appears its positioning is on the bottom left corner instead of the selected li element, which is not what i want.

3/ The Javascript section (which i suck at and is very new to me) was once working correctly but somehow now I've came back to this project, it is behaving incorrectly.

a- On pressing the enter button, the slide up and slide down containers should be animated to slide up and down revealing the 'slider' smoothly. Instead sometimes it slides half way and disappears, sometimes it just disappears without animation. Why?

b- Once on the slider section, for users to return to the landing page the logo at the top is clickable, on click the up and down slide will slide in and the logo and magic line nav will fade out, however when the slides slide in fully they disappear as the 'hidden and removed' state is forced, which is incorrect.

Any help is appreciated and would love to learn on how to correct these mistakes and why they are happening as at one point in time it was all running smoothly but cant remember what I have changed to force these errors and this is the first time coming back to this learning project in 2 months.

thanks lee
