css postion absolute greying out overflow scroll in project section ( but i need absoulte postion on slider to force stacking order for opening?)

magic line postion needs to match select li element on call out as opposed to starting in bottom left corner

javascript needs fixing for slides.up and .down and .nav/.logo/.enter as timing and function is off

clicking top logo to bring back the landing page forces 'hidden' and 'removed' error
